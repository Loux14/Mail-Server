# ***Mail Server***



* Front-end is a derivation of my other project "Mail Client", in *HTML, CSS, JavaScript*
* Back-end in Javascript, using *Node.js* and *Express.js*
* Requests are done thank to *Ajax* and *JQuery*

* Cryptography by *Node-Forge*

## Procedure

* create a user by logging in (Public and Private keys are created)
* once loggued, the computer is set for this specific user, impossible to log out (data loss in local storage)

* When sending email, encryption is performed and posted on server
* When retrieving emails (GET), all emails are retrieved, but only the decrypted ones are displayed

## Enhancement

This is a non-perfect university project (first session). 
Know issues :
* Letters.json never populated
* Slow encryption
* GET requests not always successful
